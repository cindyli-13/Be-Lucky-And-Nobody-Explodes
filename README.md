# Be-Lucky-And-Nobody-Explodes
Be Lucky and Nobody Explodes is a physical implementation of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, a game where one player, the “defuser”, must solve modular puzzles contained within a virtual “bomb under a certain time constraint, while the other players, the “experts”, must tell the defuser what to do based on their interpretation of the solution manual. Since the defuser can see the puzzles but not the solutions, while the experts know the solutions but cannot see the puzzles, communication between the two parties is key to solving puzzles efficiently and successfully defusing the bomb. The physical implementation of the game will be contained within a briefcase and will consist of 6 puzzle modules—some of which will be based on modules from Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes and some of which will be newly designed to provide an original experience. Due to its easily accessible nature, this game can be enjoyed by anyone with a mind for puzzles and is intended for groups of friends looking for a fun challenge. This project was created for the TEJ4M course.
